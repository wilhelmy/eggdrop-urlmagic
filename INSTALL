Start with cloning the hg repo. This will make updates a lot easier, in case
you find a bug (not unlikely).

   $ cd ~/eggdrop/scripts # assuming you installed eggdrop to ~/eggdrop
   $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/wilhelmy/eggdrop-urlmagic/
   [hg output omitted]

Alternatively, you can get a zip or tar.gz archive of the newest version here:
(You only need one of these files since they all contain the same things.)

   * https://bitbucket.org/wilhelmy/eggdrop-urlmagic/get/default.zip
   * https://bitbucket.org/wilhelmy/eggdrop-urlmagic/get/default.tar.gz
   * https://bitbucket.org/wilhelmy/eggdrop-urlmagic/get/default.tar.bz2

Unpack it, and place it in the subdirectory "scripts" inside the directory
whereever you installed eggdrop.

Next you need to configure it.

   $ cd eggdrop-urlmagic
   $ cp urlmagic.conf.example urlmagic.conf # create a config file from the example
   $ $EDITOR urlmagic.conf  # edit it with your favourite editor

You can also enable or disable plugins here, as well as change various ways in
which urlmagic behaves.

You will probably want to install the gumbo or arabica HTML/Tagsoup parsers.
These parsers will provide better results with broken HTML (my suggestion is to
use gumbo for best results and to avoid garbled unicode or HTML entities).

There is currently no debian package for either of them, so you may have to
compile them from source. I didn't find any other html5-capable HTML parsers
which are currently packaged by debian, if you know of one, please let me know!
(On debian stretch, it looks like you're lucky and all you have to do is
install libgumbo-dev)

If you can't compile anything at all, please use the "dumb" setting for
htmltitle. This will work in most, but not all cases.

Assuming you installed gumbo or arabica globally in /usr/local, you will need
to do the following:

  $ cd htmltitle_{whichever}

  Now edit the Makefile, fix the include path for whereever the Tcl header
  files are installed and possibly also the library path for gumbo/arabica.
  gumbo uses pkg-config so chances are you won't need to edit anything.

  $ nano Makefile
  $ make

It should look similar to this for arabica:

  g++ -fPIC -I/usr/local/include/arabica -I/usr/include/tcl8.5   -c -o htmltitle.o htmltitle.C
  g++ -shared htmltitle.o -o htmltitle.so -L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib -larabica 


And like this for gumbo:

  cc -std=c99 -fPIC -I/usr/local/include   -I/usr/include/tcl8.5   -c -o htmltitle.o htmltitle.c
  cc -shared -o htmltitle.so htmltitle.o -L/usr/local/lib -lgumbo   

That's it, unless there's a compile error, which will print this as its last
line:

  make: *** [htmltitle.o] Error 1

In that case, you can either use the dumb setting for htmltitle or poke me on
IRC.
