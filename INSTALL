You will probably want to install the gumbo or arabica HTML/Tagsoup parsers.
These parsers will provide better results with broken HTML.

If you can't compile anything at all, please use the "dumb" setting for
htmltitle. This will work in most, but not all cases.

Assuming you installed gumbo or arabica globally in /usr/local, you will need
to do the following:

  $ cd htmltitle_{whichever}

  Now edit the Makefile, fix the include path for whereever the Tcl header
  files are installed and possibly also the library path for gumbo/arabica.
  gumbo uses pkg-config so chances are you won't need to edit anything.
  $ nano Makefile
  $ make

It will look like this for arabica:
  g++ -I/usr/local/include/arabica -I/usr/include/tcl8.5   -c -o htmltitle.o htmltitle.C
  g++ -shared -L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib -larabica  htmltitle.o -o htmltitle.so

And like this for gumbo:

  $ make
  cc -std=c99 -I/usr/local/include   -I/usr/include/tcl8.5   -c -o htmltitle.o htmltitle.c
  cc -shared -L/usr/local/lib -lgumbo    htmltitle.o -o htmltitle.so

That's it, unless there's a compile error, which will print this as its last
line:

  make: *** [htmltitle.o] Error 1

In that case, you can either use the dumb setting for htmltitle or poke me on
IRC.
