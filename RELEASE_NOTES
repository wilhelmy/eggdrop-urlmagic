2014-????? (Version 2.0)

  * Rewrite twitter support to pipe tweets to an external program rather than
    dealing with the twitter mobile site.

  * Implement a plugin system so all these things can be loaded, unloaded and
    reloaded on the fly; uses hook package from tcllib

  * Improved SQL logging, added a CGI script to display the URL history

  * Fix charset detection by transferring files as binary, then applying proper
    encoding conversion/detection

  * Use the new title parser which (optionally) replaces the old/unreliable
    regular expression title search

  * Mark NSFW links with a red warning label on the channel

  * Don't print the expanded URL if an URL redirects elsewhere (mostly a
    useless feature that just adds clutter)

  * Add two htmltitle implementations using real HTML/Tagsoup parsers for
    better results

  * Miscellaneous fixes by Gargaj

  * Improved handling of url flooding ignores (per-user with optional flood
    penalty and per-channel threshold instead of global)

  * Actually enforce the maximum download limit

  * Nitpicky things about setting certain values every time a proc is invoked

2013-02-08  (Version 1.1)  -ente

  * fixed twitter support (their HTML layout has changed a bit since 2011)

  * fixed a bug where html pages without <title> tag would result in the html
    being spammed on the channel
 
  * fixed tinyurl support, use the API instead of screen scraping because it
    didn't work anymore, anyway

2011-09-06  (Version 1.0) -rojo

  * urlmagic 1.0 as released by rojo
