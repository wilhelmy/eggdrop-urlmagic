Troubleshooting
===============

I've done everything you told me to do, but it still doesn't work!
------------------------------------------------------------------

As it turns out, Tcl 8.5 has introduced some rather crucial features I don't
really want to miss. Please check .status if your bot is compiled against Tcl
8.4 or lower. If it is, maybe it's time for an update? ;)

(While you're at it, check out eggdrop 1.6.21 or 1.8 too. eggdrop has improved
significantly since below 1.6.20.)

Next, check if you can load the "hook" package from tcllib, as well as the
"http" and "tls" packages. To do this, type tclsh<version number> into your
shell, (minus the <>). For instance, if your eggdrop is using Tcl version 8.5.8
according to the .status partyline command, you type

v- this is your unix prompt
me@shellprovider:~/eggdrop$ tclsh8.5
%
^- now this is the Tcl prompt, which means that all commands you type now will
   be interpreted by Tcl

Now type the following things into the Tcl interpreter. The lines not starting
with % are the expected output. If you get an error message, something went
wrong. If you're sure that you installed all packages mentioned for your
operating system in README, please report a bug, either on IRC or on the
bitbucket page.

% package require hook
0.1
% package require tls
1.6
% package require http 2.0
2.7.7
% package require sqlite3 ;#optional, required by sqlite plugin.
3.7.13
% exit
me@shellprovider:~/eggdrop$


I have issues compiling htmltitle_gumbo
---------------------------------------

Please make sure the paths in htmltitle_gumbo/Makefile are correct, the line
containing "-Wl,-rpath" is uncommented if you need it, you are using GNU
make and you have the development tools (C compiler, system headers, ...)
installed.

You can download a statically linked 32 bit version of htmltitle_gumbo.so here:
https://bitbucket.org/wilhelmy/eggdrop-urlmagic/downloads/htmltitle_gumbo_debian_wheezy32.so
