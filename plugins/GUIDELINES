Programming guidelines for plugins:

  * You should document which eggdrop events and hooks your plugin uses or
    exports. Your subject/object names (which only serve to identify the event)
    should be urlmagic::plugin::<name>. If you define any, you should also
    document how many and what kind of parameters they take.

  * Do not execute code with side effects directly in the namespace. Instead,
    make two functions init_plugin and deinit_plugin in the

      urlmagic::plugin::<name>

    namespace so that plugins can be cleanly unloaded again. In these
    functions, any calls to hook::bind or eggdrop's bind and calls to
    hook::forget/eggdrop's "unbind" should take place, as well as
    opening/closing of e.g. database files or ports.

  * Use namespace path ::urlmagic to make urlmagic's functions available in
    your namespace.

  * Separate settings from code so users know where they can stop reading

  * Use the urlmagic::warn function to make the user aware of plugin issues
    like missing libraries

  * add a variable no_settings to your plugin namespace if you have no user
    settings.

  * Take a look at sqlite for a relatively well documented example plugin.
