Installation
============

Install gregkh's bti twitter client. If you're on debian wheezy, install it
from backports as follows, provided that the backports repo is already enabled
(you might want to google how to enable the backports repo in case it isn't):

   # apt-get -t wheezy-backports install bti

On debian jessie or later, or ubuntu, use the following command instead:

   # apt-get install bti

Fedora/(possibly also Red Hat/CentOS):

   # yum install bti

Gentoo:

   # emerge -v net-misc/bti



This will install a version of bti that is OAuth-capable.

Next, execute the following command as the user you run eggdrop as:

   $ echo 'consumer_key=cZy8DdioswAfu3LJYg6E2w' > ~/.bti
   $ echo 'consumer_secret=fnIGGU0T12mMWKjmThUdSeKN32NLWfmnwapwubVQ' >> ~/.bti

Now you'll need to run bti for the first time, which will spit out a URL that
you need to open in your web browser:

   $ bti
   Please open the following link in your browser, and allow 'bti' to access your account. Then paste back the provided PIN in here.
   https://twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=blahblahblah
   PIN: <enter pin here>
   Please put these two lines in your bti configuration file (/home/you/.bti):
   access_token_key=yaddayadda
   access_token_secret=blablablablabla

Append the access_token and access_token_secret stuff to ~/.bti. Now you can
test if tweeting from the command line works by running bti.

Then, add the twitter settings from twitter.conf to your config file and edit
them.


Scripting
=========

In order to use the tweet command in a script, check if it exists before
invoking it:

  if {[info commands ::urlmagic::plugins::twitter::tweet] != {}} {
    ::urlmagic::plugins::twitter::tweet $mytext
  }

A script that allows channel members to tweet things can be found in twerp.tcl.
