	# Alternatively, you can use another command that reads a tweet from
	# stdin and posts it to twitter.

	# You'll need to set this flag on all channels where you want to tweet
	# URLs. If you don't want to tweet URLs at all, e.g. if you're using
	# the twitter plugin in another script to tweet, just don't set this
	# udef flag on any channels.
	set settings(udef-flag) "tweet-urls"

	# If you want the udef-flag to have no effect at all (just to make sure
	# no untrustworthy channel owner sets it on their channel or something

	# URLs in case you want to use the twitter plugin to tweet things from
	# another script.
