# Uncomment either of the following lines, gumbo is recommended but will
# require you to install the Google gumbo library and to compile a Tcl module
# in the subdirectory "htmltitle_gumbo". arabica is another such module using
# the arabica HTML/tagsoup parser. Finally, "dumb" is an implementation written
# in Tcl, which uses a simple regex. This doesn't always work, but should be
# okay most of the time. Use this if you can't compile code for some reason.
# Currently, best results are achieved by using the gumbo library, which is the
# default for that reason. However, it is not packaged on most Linux
# distributions as of mid 2014. A workaround is to use the implementation in
# perl (which has additional dependencies, see below as well as the README)
set settings(htmltitle) "gumbo"
#set settings(htmltitle) "arabica"
